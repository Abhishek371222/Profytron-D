| abhishek | Sunday: plan load-test week; declare M7 status |

| **aaradhya** | Rest |
| kushwaha | Rest |
| ishit | Rest / schedule posts |


## Cross-sheet micro-checks (end of day — do all that apply)
- [ ] **Master Tracker**: status/hours/notes for any task touched
- [ ] **Website Checklist**: SEO/Code Ready / Prod Live if page shipped
- [ ] **Testing Dashboard**: Eng Status if module improved
- [ ] **KPI Dashboard**: LCP or activation if measured
- [ ] **SEO Tracker**: if keyword page shipped
- [ ] **Daily Standup**: yesterday/today/blockers 3 lines
- [ ] **Launch Countdown**: M3 if LCP+hero progressed

## Quality bar (nothing half-done)
- Work is not “done” without evidence
- Prefer one finished PT-* over three half-finished UI tweaks
- If day is Rest: only P0 prod burns; update plan gaps instead of inventing features

## Sign-off
- [ ] All blocks attempted or consciously deferred with reason
- [ ] Evidence folder/links posted
- [ ] Tomorrow’s first block pre-noted
